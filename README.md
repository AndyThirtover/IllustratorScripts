Scripts for Adobe Illustrator

These are helper scripts that automate the construction of gauges and graphs.  It's a real pain to construct these by hand, so on the principle of 'If you do something three times - get a computer to do it' I've create these scripts.

The plan here is to layout the values, circles, ticks and grids as needed.

The values, ticks and grids will be on different layers so that final design choices can be made in Illustrator.

All of the required constants are at the begining of Javascript so that they are easy to modify.

Linear and Log versions are here.

For CS6 You'll need to use the Adobe 'ExtendScript toolkit' to run these.

With Illustrator 2019 you can use the File->Script [Other Script] menu to run this.
